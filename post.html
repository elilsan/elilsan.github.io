                        <p>It has almost been a year since I have last been to Vancouver and I am reflecting on my experience as I write this.</p>
                        <p>Although, it was not my first time visitng, it was still just as pretty and chilly as I remembered.</p>
                        <p>While I was there, I was again reminded of how clean the city was along with its majestic mountains in the background. Everything about its landscape was so beautiful and I took my time just living in the moment.</p>
                        <p>Although I personally would probably never live there, visiting the city is just as satisfying. I think that its a good weekend getaway place, but the unaffordability is a real issue. I hope that the economy improves there for the sake of its residents.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Tijuana, Mexico</h2>
                        <p>On the other hand, I have also been to Tijuana, Mexico, which is the complete opposite of Vancouver. From the climate to the landscape, Tijuana was so different yet just as beautiful.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">To be able to travel with my family â€“ was both exciting yet frustrating.</span>
                        <p>Visitng Mexico once more was just as exciting. Since both of my parents are from there, I think that its truly comforting and fortunate for them to visit their home country as often as they do.</p>
                        <p>In the future I would like to visit Mexico more often in order to connect with my culture, and also be able to experience different places than the ones that I have been to.</p>
